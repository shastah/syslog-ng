# This is the experimental transport for transferring messages in whole
# between syslog-ng instances.
#
# EWMM stands for "enterprise wide message model", which is also kind of an
# experimental name, but so far it stuck.
#
# Format:
#   - program name should be "@syslog-ng" which is used to recognize this message
#   - name-values are encoded as JSON in the MSG field
#   - name-value pairs that start with "._" should be hop-by-hop fields only
#     to transmit syslog-ng <> syslog-ng information and is not considered
#     part of the original message.
#   - regexp numeric matches ($0 .. $255) are not transmitted
#
